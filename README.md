### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code

Before pushing any changes, format the project locally by running:

```bash
npm run format:fix
```

### Linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is an automation tool, used to save time by making sure everyone's code is following the
same standards. By using ESLint we can avoid wasting time on code reviews for simple things like formatting and naming
conventions.

Linting configuration lives in eslint `.eslintrc.json`

Before pushing any changes, lint the project locally by running:

```bash
npm run lint
```
